# Predicting-Building-Energy-Consumption

Buildings consume a significant amount of energy, and energy consumption accounts for a large portion of the operating costs of a building. Accurate prediction of building energy consumption can help building managers optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and meet regulatory requirements. Traditional methods of predicting building energy consumption rely on simple statistical models that do not account for complex relationships between different attributes of a building. These models often fail to provide accurate predictions, leading to suboptimal energy usage and increased costs.
Machine learning models have been shown to be effective in predicting building energy consumption as they can account for complex relationships between different attributes of a building. However, developing such models can be a complex and time-consuming process. In this report, we present a product idea for predicting building energy consumption using machine learning. The product uses various machine learning algorithms and techniques for feature selection and model training and is developed using open-source libraries and frameworks such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and keras. The product can be used by building managers to optimize energy usage and reduce costs. By accurately predicting building energy consumption, the product can help building managers make informed decisions about energy usage and reduce the environmental impact of their buildings.
